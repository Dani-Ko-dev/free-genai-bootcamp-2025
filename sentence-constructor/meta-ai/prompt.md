Bonjour! Let's work through this sentence together. Here's a table of vocabulary:
 -----------------------------------------
|   French	   |  Syllabus	   |  English
|   Chat	   |  Noun	       |  Cat
|   Porte	   |  Noun	       |  Door
|   Poubelle   |  Noun	       |  Garbage
|   Être	   |  Verb	       |  Be
|   Laisser	   |  Verb	       |  Leave
|   Dehors	   |  Adverb	   |  Out
|   Vous	   |  Pronoun	   |  You
-----------------------------------------

#### Possible sentence structure:

    Verb (être) + Subject (chat) + ... + Object (porte)
    Question Word + Verb (laisser) + ... + Object (poubelle) + Adverb (dehors)
    To get started:
    How would you conjugate the verb "être" (to be) in the present tense for the subject "cats"?
    What particle would you use to indicate the location of the cats (e.g., "at the door")?
    How would you form the question "did you leave" using the verb "laisser" (to leave)?
    Work through these questions, and we'll build the sentence together!

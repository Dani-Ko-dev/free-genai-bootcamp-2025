üèóÔ∏è Sentence Structure
Did you see [noun] [time]?

[You] + [verb (past tense)] + [noun] + [time]
They were looking at [noun].

[They] + [verb (imparfait)] + [noun]
üîç Clues and Considerations
The question is in the pass√© compos√©, so you need to conjugate voir correctly with the right auxiliary.
"This morning" is a time marker; think about where it should go in the sentence.
"Raven" is the direct object of "see." Do you need an article before it?
"They were looking at" implies an ongoing action in the past, so which tense should you use for regarder?
"Our garden" ‚Üí Which possessive adjective fits here?
"They" can be masculine or feminine‚Äîhow does that affect the verb form?
